			<p class="title"> Geylang Night Trip </p>

			<p class="write_up">
				<p class= "paragraph">
					This photo trip was sparked due to one random reading i was doing on human trafficking which led to further reading with regards to legal prostitution in Singapore. Personally, felt that as long as it was a legal trade and that they were earning their own keep, there's nothing much to despise about.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Along with my fellow photobuddy, Cheese, we bought red ginberas, to give to the ladies we might see at this red light district. Hopefully, it would brighten up their night,before a long day at work. 
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					It was a long night walk. We even had time to stop for a durian break.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					The ladies who took the flowers were slightly taken aback. Probably intimidated by our cameras. However, it wasn't long before they returned a smile.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					I love receiving flowers myself but the feeling of giving them out feels as good as well.

			<p class="write_up">
				<p class= "paragraph">
					I had a stopover in hongkong. It took me quite some time to realise that the roads were actually sealed off, due to all these gantries. 
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Support poured in via different forms. Not all came in the form of kicking a big hoo-hah.
				</p>

			<i>
				<p class= "paragraph">
					Office workers who came down after knocking off and packed their dinner to eat them while sitting along the road.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Students reading their books quietly.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Speakers placing their point across to an audience without screaming their lungs out.
				</p>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Different religious groups having small booths, doing their own form of praying to whoever that is up there.
				</p>
			</i>

				<p class= "paragraph">
					Interesting sight for a tourist who had no intentions of walking in, except to see if there was a discount going on, hence the huge crowd.
